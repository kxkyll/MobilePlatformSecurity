Assignment 4 - Android Key Store

"Benefits of a hardware-backed Android Key Store implementation. 
What are the benefits for a 3rd party application developer? 
How would your answer change if you consider the software-based implemention."

The Android Key Store implementation allows 3rd party applications to create, 
store and use their keys (and other secrets) in a secure manner via a the provided API. 
By using Key Store only the application (identified by uid) that created the key can access it.
Depending of the device the Key Store implementation can be hardware-backed or based on software.
In a hardware implementation keys are generated outside the Android operating system and are not 
directly accessible by the system or the root user. So the hardware implementation ensures well that
only the application has access to it's own keys. This can of course vary depending on the device 
hardware implementation. In software implementation the keys are encrypted with a user specific 
encryption key. Which is as secure as the encryption is. The software implementation is the fall-back 
mode if the device does not support hardware-backed Key Store.
