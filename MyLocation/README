Shortcomings:

I was not able to get the service work as an external module, 
so I implemented it to the same package using the 
process:remote command in manifest to have it run it's own process.

The code currently contains an extra file: MessengerServiceActivity.java as 
I wanted to start the service with own Intent. This worked ok, but I was not able to stop the service using an intent so I copied the code 
to the original Activity called MyLocation.

I tested the location sending to client with a simple string and a counter 
bundle.putString("loc", "location is "+counter)  in
method sendLocationToClients in class MessengerService and it is updating 
the location to UI.

Now I'm too tired to figure out how to test the location service using 
gpx files, but leave it to some later moment.

I learnt a lot and had fun doing this.
